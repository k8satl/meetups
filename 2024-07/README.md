        - **Flox: Switch and Stack Toolboxes on your Developer Workbench**<!--presentation title-->

            Flox is a new OS package manager + dev-environment tool built into one. It's got a simple interface built on top of Nix, meaning you can use over 100,000+ packages, We also make older package versions available, and it works across Linux and MacOS with x86_64/ARM/Apple Silicon chips. This is super important because Flox lets you build and version your environments. Then you can stack and share them with the people you want to collab with., while enjoying the power of your actual hardware, and the comfort of $HOME.

            Come join in for a live demo on this new, open-source tool, and learn how you can use and on the Flox project ðŸ™‚
