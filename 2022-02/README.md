        - **Cluster-API Overview**<!--presentation title-->

            Operating and managing Kubernetes clusters at scale is hard. In this talk, we'll review how the Kubernetes Cluster-API (CAPI) project provides declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs for cluster provisioning and management across different clouds and environments. Following the deep-dive into the Cluster-API fundamentals and architecture, there will be live demos targeting both public and bare-metal environments.

        - **Learning Go (no, not that one)**<!--presentation title-->

            Weiqi, Igo, Baduk and Go are the common names for this ancient Chinese game. You have seen it in movies, and maybe in the news in the past few years because of the AlphaGo project, but do you know how to play? We will go over some of the history, some vocabulary, and the rules of this fascinating game. It is easy to learn, but a lifetime to master.
