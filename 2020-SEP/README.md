- **Location:**
    - [Virtual via Zoom](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-Atlanta-Meetup/events/272847703/)
    - NOTE: You must login to Meetup to view the Zoom link
- **Topics:**
    - Securing your Pipelines (from build to post mortem)
        - Dan "POP" Papandrea @ Sysdig
        - Steven Terrana @ Booz Allen<!--presentation title-->

        In this talk, Steven and Pop take a look at defense-in-depth to secure production workloads running on Kubernetes throughout the entire software development lifecycle. We’ll show a live demonstration of using CNCF projects like Helm, Open Policy Agent, Falco ( and Sysdig Secure), and Argo to secure Kubernetes clusters. With a secure cluster, we’ll then show how to leverage DevSecOps principles to incorporate security into every step of the software development lifecycle and how to scale your CI/CD pipelines using the open source Jenkins Template Engine.

        This talk is the result of lessons learned supporting multiple horizontals of end users, including financial organizations and federal modern software delivery in support of government agencies.

        Specifically, attendees will walk away with actionable plans for how to implement:
        - Pipeline Security along with additional extensions.
        - Container/host configuration management policies
        - Protection against runtime threats
        - Automating changes
        - Post-mortem and prevention
- **Hosts:**
    - @alex.b
    - @phenixblue
