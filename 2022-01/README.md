        - **Secure Supply Chain, Tekton Chains**<!--presentation title-->

            Supply chain attacks have become predominant in the past few years and companies are scrambling to secure their software supply chain. Trying to understand and overcome this problem is no easy feat.

            Various tools and cloud native solutions have stepped up to help ease the integration of security practices based on SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) security levels. Tekton, a cloud native solution for building CI/CD systems, is one of these tools that has a lot to offer. With the addition of Tekton Chains, companies are empowered to shift security left and create DevSecOps pipelines to improve the security of their build and release process.

            Learn more about Tekton Chains and how it can be used with Tekton Pipelines (CI/CD) to create signed provenance! In this presentation we will walk through initial setup, configuration and how to verify the final provenance.

        - **Managing Kubernetes workloads and clusters with Kyverno**<!--presentation title-->

            Handling workloads and clusters in Kubernetes can be very tricky and challenging. That is why Kyverno offers a solution to these configuration channels via policies and shares. Kyverno, a CNCF project, is a popular policy engine designed for Kubernetes. It provides an easy way to validate settings, generates defaults and mutates resources, using policies. In addition, Kyverno can easily check your existing cluster configurations against a set of customizable rules, and help you move towards enforcing best practices for security, isolation, and resiliency across clusters. This allows DevOps teams to use familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies. In this session, Jim will provide an overview of Kyverno and walk through some real-world examples of using policies. He will highlight how you can Write and generate policies and in turn aid your teamâ€™s collaboration
