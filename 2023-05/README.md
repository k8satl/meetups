        **Whitney** is a lovable goofball who enjoys understanding and using tools in the cloud native landscape. Creative and driven, Whitney recently pivoted from an art-related career to one in tech. She is active in the open source community, especially around CNCF projects focused on developer productivity. You can catch her lightboard streaming show ⚡️ Enlightning on Tanzu.TV. She also co-hosts the streaming show You Choose! - a 'Choose-Your-Own-Adventure'-style journey through the CNCF landscape. And not only does she rock at tech - she literally has toured playing in the band Mutual Benefit on keyboards and vocals.
        
        - **Choose Your Own Adventure: The Treacherous Trek to Development**<!--presentation title-->

            From the moment of their inception as source code on the developer’s laptop, our hero knows that they are destined for great things. They long to be a real, running application, living in production, serving end users! But the epic journey to production is an arduous one, filled with cascading choices—choices concerning container build strategy, image registries, application configuration, adding and managing a database, migrating database schema, and Kubernetes-native development, to name a few. And who knows what other unseen forces lurk in the shadows! One wrong step could be catastrophic.

            It is up to us, the audience, to guide our hero; and to help them grow from source code to container image, to the first pitstop on their journey- running in a development environment. In this ‘Choose Your Own Adventure’-style talk, Whitney and Viktor will present a linear view of all of the choices that an anthropomorphized application must make as they try to find their way to the fabled land of development. Throughout the presentation, the audience will use a voting app to choose which path our hero application will take. Can we navigate CNCF projects and avoid pitfalls and dead-ends to get our application to development before the session time elapses?

        - **Building, Deploying and Managing APIs in K8s**<!--presentation title-->

            Learning by doing is paramount in acquiring practical skills, particularly in the realm of API development. We'll explore building a simple Python/Node API and deploying it on Minkube/GKE and then adding security to it and exposing it.

            During this event, we will cover how to:
            - Create a node API
            - Dockerize it
            - Add an API definition for security/publishing
            - Package it with a helm
            - Deploy to Kubernetes
