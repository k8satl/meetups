        - **Cilium and Istio: better together with CAKE**<!--presentation title-->

            Modern application architectures based on microservices, containers, and APIs need a modern approach to networking. Cilium and Istio both provide compelling solutions for different layers in the network but also have some overlap. At KubeCon NA 23 we introduced the concept of the “CAKES stack” -- a modern application networking stack based on best of breed components for networking: Cilium, Ambient mesh (Istio), Kubernetes, Envoy, and SPIFFE/SPIRE. In this talk, we understand how these technologies complement each other to solve challenges around zero trust, observability, traffic policy enforcement, API management and global failover.
