- **Location:**
    - Virtual via Zoom
- **Speakers:**

    - **Moshe Shitrit @ Sysdig** <!--presenter name @ company-->
    
        Moshe is a Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Sysdig, where he is responsible for building and maintaining a set of tools used for all things automation. Moshe has played various roles in the IT area for over 14 years. He has been a Kubernetes enthusiast for the past 6 years, and has been a contributor to the project for over year.
        
        - **A Simple GitOps Workflow in Action - GitHub Actions, Kustomize, ArgoCD and Bitnami SealedSecrets**<!--presentation title-->

            GitOps is becoming more and more popular due to the desire to automate as much as possible. In this talk, we‚Äôll go through one way of achieving the goal of automated CI/CD using a combination of free / open source tools. We‚Äôll have a simple REST API running in a k8s cluster, having its codebase stored in GitHub. We‚Äôll look at the GitHub actions workflow that we use to build our code upon our desired triggers, and keep diving until we see our new code running in our k8s cluster.
            
    - **Andy Holtzmann @ Equinix** <!--presenter name @ company-->
    
        Andy is an engineer at Packet (an Equinix company). During his time working with Kubernetes, he helped Sendgrid do their initial k8s migration and helping implement the start of their initial cluster api 2.0 project. He joined Equinix Metal to help them consolidate from 3 other platforms to Kubernetes as one platform to rule them all.
        
        - **Lessons Learned from Equinix's K8s migration**<!--presentation title-->

            Joining a new company can be full of surprises and it‚Äôs funny how many meanings ‚Äúwe run in a containerized environment‚Äù can take on. While the primary delivery mechanism for application code might be an OCI container the supporting deployment, secret management, operational burden, and organization‚Äôs cognition load can differ wildly. Here are some of the lessons learned in consolidating for 4 platforms to 1, and the far reaching impacts it had on an entire engineering org.
