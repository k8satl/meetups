        - **Securing GitOps Debug Access with Pinniped, Dex, and GitHub**<!--presentation title-->

            Git alone provides a pretty mediocre inner-loop for deployment to a cluster -- Git is powerful for collaboration, but it’s not a debugger.

            However, git platforms can still add value for debugging!
            Roles and group membership are usually weaved into the habits teams build around git repos. This can be combined within the authentication and authorization systems used in a multi-cluster Kubernetes platform!

            In this live demo, Leigh will show how the incredibly flexible, open-source combo of Flux (fluxcd.io) , Pinniped (pinniped.dev/), and Dex (dexidp.io/) can empower a team to leave a traceable solution during a production incident. Let’s explore effective team debugging habits with Kubernetes and git :)

        - **A Primer on Kubernetes Load Testing & Benchmarking**<!--presentation title-->

            Ok, you've got your Kubernetes clusters...they're running ok...but sometimes they just start to feel slow, runtimes take longer, packets and requests get dropped, and you're not sure if it happened after your last CNI upgrade or that CVE patch a few kernels ago. Being able to simulate load, at scale, on-demand, and track changes over time is important. We'll discuss the differences between load testing and benchmarking, when and why you would perform one over the other, and some of the common tools you can use for each.
