    - **Spinnaker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes: A sturdy ship ready to set sail**
        - Marky Jackson @ OpsMX

            > Every organization that has chosen the DevOps way wants to do "Continuous" everything, be it integration, deployment, testing, or monitoring. For a DevOps operation, CI/CD is very important for any small or big size organization to shorter development cycles and innovate faster, reduce deployment failures, safe rollbacks and reduce MTTR (mean time to recover).
            > In this meetup, Marky will uncover a new way of bringing continuous integration and continuous delivery of applications to your Kubernetes cluster. He will be using Jenkins as the CI tool, which will poll the Git repositories to build Docker images on commits and push it to the Docker registry. He will use Spinnaker as the CD tool, which continuously polls the Docker registry and triggers the deployment pipelines to update applications in your Kubernetes cluster.
            > 
            > Marky Jackson is a software developer and director of open-source software at OpsMX. He is a lover of family, friends, and a die-hard San Francisco Giants fan.
            > Marky is a Jenkins core code maintainer, SIG mentoring lead, org admin for Google Summer of Code and Google Summer of Docs.
            > Marky is also a Kubernetes org member, release lead associate for all quarterly releases, SIG leader, and administrator throughout the project.
